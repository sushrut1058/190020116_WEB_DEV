	<p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			I am an otaku and spend most of my time binge-watching anime. Although I seldom write reviews, even so I enjoy writing them. It's a weird hobby and therefore I'm not really overt about it.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			I like music and love singing.
		</li>

		<li>
			I'm also interested in web security and I sometimes do CTFs or hackthissite.org missions.

	<h2 align="center">Ambitions</h2>
	<p>
		I aim to become a person who can get decent results with minimal efforts. My idea of ambition isn't really governed by jobs or goals in the near future because of me being a nihilist. Well, I won't expect exceptional results from myself with such a petty psychology which also might sound ludicrous to some, but if it doesn't then I guess we can be friends :)
