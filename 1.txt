		<ul>
		<li>
			I am an otaku and spend most of my time binge-watching anime. Although I seldom write reviews, even so I enjoy writing them. It's a weird hobby and therefore I'm not really overt about it.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			I like music and love singing.
		</li>

		<li>
			I'm also interested in web security and I sometimes do CTFs or hackthissite.org missions.
